**Web Development Report**

Web development is the process of creating websites and web applications that operate over the internet. It involves a combination of skills, technologies, and tools used to design, build, and maintain platforms that allow users to interact with digital content. Today, web development plays a key role in business, communication, education, and entertainment, making it a fundamental part of the modern digital world. The field continues to evolve rapidly, adapting to new technologies, devices, and user expectations.

Web development can be divided into two main areas: frontend development and backend development. Frontend development focuses on the part of a website that users see and interact with, using core technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with frameworks like React or Vue to enhance functionality and design. Backend development handles the server logic, database interactions, and application processing using technologies such as Node.js, Python, PHP, Java, or Ruby, supported by databases like MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL. Together, frontend and backend development form what is known as full-stack development, enabling the creation of complete and functional applications.

In recent years, different technology stacks have emerged, offering structured ways to build web applications more efficiently. Stacks like MERN, .NET, and Spring Boot combine frontend, backend, and database technologies to streamline development. Each stack has its advantages based on performance, scalability, flexibility, and project requirements.

Web development continues to grow as new tools, frameworks, and standards appear. The increasing demand for responsive design, security, integration with cloud computing, and mobile compatibility makes the field both challenging and exciting. Overall, web development remains essential in shaping digital experiences, connecting users with information, services, and businesses across the world.
